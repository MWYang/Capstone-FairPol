I have been aided in many ways by many faculty over the past year and a half. First and foremost, I'd like to thank Professor Fost for being an excellent advisor: always helpful and exceedingly fair in his criticism and praise. I'd also like to thank Professor Srebro (TTIC) for introducing me to fair machine learning; Professor Sarwate (Rutgers) for sharpening my intuitions on this topic; Professor Sterne for providing me with my first research experience; and Professor Wisor for many valuable conversations. Finally, I'd like to thank my friends, especially Abby, and family for supporting me during this time.
